/**
 * MultiFormTest
 * 
 * @TODO create some behavioural test cases, such as examining what occurs after
 * submitting the "previous", "next" form actions that a user would normally
 * be doing.
 * 
 * For testing purposes, we have some test MultiForm classes:
 * 
 *  - MultiFormTestClass (subclass of MultiForm)
 *  - MultiFormTestStepOne (subclass of MultiFormStep - the first step)
 *  - MultiFormTestStepTwo (subclass of MultiFormStep - the second step)
 *  - MultiFormTestStepThree (subclass of MultiFormStep - the third step)
 * 
 * These test classes should be used for testing the operation of a "real"
 * instance of this multiform step system. Also, as a note here: every instance
 * of MultiFormStep, which is every step in a form, requires a db/build, as it
 * is a subclass of DataObject. This is a bit of a pain, but it's required for
 * the database to store the step data for each step, which is very important!
