Thickbox Reloaded
================================================

What's new?

* Chainable method to bind Thickbox to links and forms.
* Confirm type Thickbox, triggered by binding Thickbox to a form.
* Automatic type detection depending on type of element, respectively on type of link:
    image: href is an image
    content: href is a hash
    ajax: href is internal and not image
    iframe: href is external and not image
    confirm: element is form
* Improved UI blocking (Thanks to Mike "Malsup")
* Options for width/height are now passed in as settings object literal or are
  stored as default values via $.thickbox.defaults({ width: 300, height: 400 })
* Optional for top/left positioning (instead of centering), unit defaults to 'px'
* Easier skins: The look is separated into an extra style sheet
* Scrolling via mousewheel/touchpad is blocked
* Lets you define custom animations for showing the modal window
* Requires jQuery 1.1.1
