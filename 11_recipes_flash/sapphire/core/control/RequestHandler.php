/**
 * This class is the base class of any Sapphire object that can be used to handle HTTP requests.
 * 
 * Any RequestHandler object can be made responsible for handling its own segment of the URL namespace.
 * The {@link Director} begins the URL parsing process; it will parse the beginning of the URL to identify which
 * controller is being used.  It will then call {@link handleRequest()} on that Controller, passing it the parameters that it
 * parsed from the URL, and the {@link HTTPRequest} that contains the remainder of the URL to be parsed.
 *
 * You can use ?debug_request=1 to view information about the different components and rule matches for a specific URL.
 *
 * In Sapphire, URL parsing is distributed throughout the object graph.  For example, suppose that we have a search form
 * that contains a {@link TreeMultiSelectField} named "Groups".  We want to use ajax to load segments of this tree as they are needed
 * rather than downloading the tree right at the beginning.  We could use this URL to get the tree segment that appears underneath
 * Group #36: "admin/crm/SearchForm/field/Groups/treesegment/36"
 *  - Director will determine that admin/crm is controlled by a new ModelAdmin object, and pass control to that.
 *    Matching Director Rule: "admin/crm" => "ModelAdmin" (defined in mysite/_config.php)
 *  - ModelAdmin will determine that SearchForm is controlled by a Form object returned by $this->SearchForm(), and pass control to that.
 *    Matching $url_handlers: "$Action" => "$Action" (defined in RequestHandler class)
 *  - Form will determine that field/Groups is controlled by the Groups field, a TreeMultiselectField, and pass control to that.
 *    Matching $url_handlers: 'field/$FieldName!' => 'handleField' (defined in Form class)
 *  - TreeMultiselectField will determine that treesegment/36 is handled by its treesegment() method.  This method will return an HTML fragment that is output to the screen.
 *    Matching $url_handlers: "$Action/$ID" => "handleItem" (defined in TreeMultiSelectField class)
 *
 * {@link RequestHandler::handleRequest()} is where this behaviour is implemented.
